The gamepad is the standard input method in console games, but it can also be used in other devices such as PCs, and thanks to the `gamepad` package it is really easy to incorporate it into your game.

First of all, you will need to add the package as a dependency to your game. You can do it using the command line `clockwork-tools`, opening a command line in your project folder and typing

`clockwork add gamepad`

Once you have added the dependency, you just need to spawn a `gamepad` object in any level you want to detect gamepad input. Add it to the level like this:

{% highlight xml %}
<object name="gamepad" type="gamepad" x="0" y="0" ></object>
{% endhighlight %}

and you will be ready to start detecting keyboard input!

The `gamepad` object you just created will trigger several events that let you know when the user is interacting with it, here is a component that will listen to all of them:

{% highlight js %}
{
    name: "gamepadListener",
    events: [
        {
            name: "gamepadAxis", code: function (event) {
                //This event is triggered each frame, sends the state of the thumbsticks
                event.player; //The id of the gamepad
                event.values.forEach(function(thumbstick, i){
                    i; //The id of the thumbstick
                    thumbstick.x; //The x value of that thumbstick
                    thumbstick.y; //The y value of that thumbstick
                });
            }
        },
        {
            name: "gamepadTrigger", code: function (event) {
                //This event is triggered each frame, sends the state of the triggers
                event.player; //The id of the gamepad
                event.leftValue; //The value of the left trigger
                event.rightValue; //The value of the right trigger
            }
        },
        {
            name: "gamepadDown", code: function (event) {
                //This event is triggered when a button is pressed
                event.player; //The id of the gamepad
                event.name; //The name of the button
            }
        },
        {
            name: "gamepadUp", code: function (event) {
                //This event is triggered when a button is released
                event.player; //The id of the gamepad
                event.name; //The name of the button
            }
        },
         {
            name: "gamepadDisconnected", code: function (event) {
                //This event is triggered when a gamepad is disconnected
                event.player; //The id of the gamepad
            }
        }
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Just like that, you can add your own logic to detect gamepad input and act acordingly.

Finally, remember that if you need to remember something about how the component is used, you can quickly access the package documentation from Visual Studio Code, running the `Browse Clockwork package documentation` command.
